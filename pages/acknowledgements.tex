%TODO: Acknowledgments
I would like to express my sincere appreciation to my advisor Christoph Doblander, for his support and guidance throughout my thesis. His valuable knowledge helped to take this work into new directions.

I would also like to thank Prof. Dr. Hans-Arno Jacobsen, for not only supervising my thesis but also for all the lessons I have learned from him during the two years of my master's study.

Last but not the least, I would like to thank all the faculties at my department for their support and guidance.
