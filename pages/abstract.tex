%TODO: Abstract

Publish-subscribe middleware paradigm is a scalable solution for large scale distributed systems. Due to its asynchronous nature, it provides a simple interface for clients in addition to the high degree of decoupling between the publishers and subscribers. To achieve high-throughput, state of the art in the realm of publish-subscribe paradigm implements a Shared Dictionary Compression for Publish-subscribe (SSPS). However, the present implementation of SSPS is on a centralized broker.

In a Simple Shared Dictionary Compression for Publish-subscribe, the component, Sampling Broker (SB) is responsible for the creation of the dictionaries, observation of the compression ratio and maintenance of the dictionary. However, one of the major drawbacks is that the broker is a centralized entity and hence it is prone to all the drawbacks of a centralized system like single point failure, limited scalability and so on.

In this thesis, we have developed an Android application to demonstrate SSPS for mobile applications. Further, we develop a prototypical implementation of the SSPS on a distributed broker called Apache ActiveMQ Artemis with the aim to overcome the disadvantages of the current implementation of SSPS.
