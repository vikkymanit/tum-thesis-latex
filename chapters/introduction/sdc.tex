\section{Shared Dictionary Compression}

Shared Dictionary Compression(SDC) is the idea of using dictionaries for achieving compression of data transmitted between the sender and receiver. The dictionaries can either be stored locally, or it can be uploaded from some source and then cached. One of the paper\parencite{Bell:1989:MTC:76894.76896} that uses the dictionary based compression for English text using a small dictionary mentions compression ratio of 60\%-70\%. This idea is further explored by J. Bentley and D. Mcllroy in \parencite{755678} and subsequently extended in \parencite{Bentley:2001:DCL:508081.508083}.

The core of the Shared Dictionary Compression is the generation of the dictionary. The generation of the dictionary is done by mining the long common strings from the context. FemtoZip \parencite{femtozip} is an open-source solution by Garrick Toubassi \parencite{sdc_linkedin}.

This idea of SDC was introduced in the realm of publish-subscribe pattern in the work Simple Shared Dictionary Compression for Publisher-Subscriber (SSPS) model \parencite{Doblander:2016:SDC}. Here the similarity between the notifications is leveraged to improve compression ratios. The SDC here is a combination of a dictionary and multiple passes of Huffman Coding. Using this method, the references to the dictionary are represented very efficiently.
