\subsection{RabbitMQ}

RabbitMQ is an open source asynchronous messaging broker \parencite{richardson2008introduction}. It was written in Erlang which is a functional programming language that is well suited for distributed applications. It was developed initially by Rabbit Technologies Ltd. and currently belongs to Pivotal Software, Inc.

RabbitMQ has a rich set of features \parencite{rabbitmq_features}. It has clients for many languages such as Java, Ruby, PHP, Python and many more. It supports protocols such as AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, and HTTP either directly or via plugins. RabbitMQ supports clustering across LAN and clustering over WAN is not recommended. For high availability, the message queues are replicated to all the slaves. For persistence, RabbitMQ uses its own message store that is shared among all the queues on the server. 

RabbitMQ comes with management UI that facilitates the control and monitoring of every aspect of the broker. Also, it also comes with a range of plugins to extend it in different ways, with support to write your own plugin.
