\chapter{Distributed Broker}\label{chapter:distributed_broker}

A distributed broker is a distributed system that aims to tackle the drawbacks of a centralized broker like single point failure, computational bottleneck, etc \parencite{distributed_broker}. As this thesis is about a prototypical implementation of the SSPS on a distributed broker, this chapter discusses the few of the major distributed brokers. This chapter is divided into three section. The first section discusses few of the major distributed brokers. In particular, it discusses the following brokers.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Apache ActiveMQ
  \item HornetQ
  \item Apache Kafka
  \item RabbitMQ
  \item Apache ActiveMQ Artemis
\end{itemize}

The second section discusses different aspects such as scalability, performance, message persistence and so on with regards to these brokers. Finally, the last section explains briefly about our selection of one broker among the discussed brokers for the prototypical SSPS implementation.
