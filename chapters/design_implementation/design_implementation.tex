\chapter{Design and Implementation}\label{chapter:design_implementation}

This chapter discusses the detailed design and implementation of both the Android application to demonstrate the SSPS and the implementation of SSPS on Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. This chapter is divided into two sections; the first section deals with the design and implementation details of the Android application and the second section describes the overall architecture of the SSPS with the Android application as a client (subscriber). Further, it discusses the functionality of the Android application. The second section deals with the design and prototypical extension to Apache ActiveMQ Artemis to incorporate SSPS. This section would describe how the extension would fit into the existing architecture of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. Further, the adaptive sampling algorithm of SSPS is described which would be used in the extension that we develop for Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. Next, it discusses the implementation details of the extension using Interceptor. Finally, the details of implementation in case failover are discussed.
