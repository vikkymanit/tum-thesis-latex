\chapter{Design and Implementation}\label{chapter:design_implementation}

This chapter discusses the detailed design and implementation of both the Android application to demonstrate the SSPS and the implementation of SSPS on Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. This chapter is divided into two sections; the first section deals with the design and implementation details of the Android application. Under the first section the functionality of the Android application is also discussed. The second section deals with the design and implementation of a prototypical extension to incorporate SSPS on Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. This section would describe how the extension would fit into the existing architecture of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. Further under the second section, the adaptive sampling algorithm of SSPS is described which is used by the Sampling Broker. It also explains how the modules in the extension interact. Finally, the details of implementation in case of failover are discussed.
