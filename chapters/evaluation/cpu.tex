\subsection{CPU and Memory Utilization} \label{cpu}

\subsubsection{Setup}

For measuring CPU and memory utilization for SSPS on Apache ActiveMQ Artemis the setup remains same as the setup for examining the throughput \ref{subsubsection:throughput_setup}. Except that we no longer need to limit the bandwidth on the subscriber end as the system under test is only the broker.

\subsubsection{Result}

The CPU utilization was measured in detail for various events such as sending and receiving uncompressed/compressed message to/from a queue, publishing dictionary and caching dictionary. Table \ref{table:cpu_utilization} shows the events and the corresponding CPU time in milliseconds.

\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    Event & Time (ms) \\
\midrule
    Sending uncompressed message to queue & 1.704772629 \\
    Receiving uncompressed message from queue & 2.329559 \\
    Sending compressed message to queue & 1.43901553 \\
    Receiving compressed message from queue    & 1.126042145 \\
    Sending dictionary to queue & 1.959809 \\
    Receiving dictionary from queue & 1.199765 \\
    Publishing dictionary & 122.71964 \\
    Caching dictionary & 4.558563 \\

The memory utilization while running SSPS on Apache ActiveMQ Artemis was observed to be \textasciitilde62 MB.
