\chapter{Future work}\label{chapter:future}

There is good potential for future work for both parts of this thesis. The demonstration of SSPS for mobile applications shows the potential for SSPS to be used for real world IoT applications. 

Since the second part of the thesis is a prototypical implementation of SSPS on Apache ActiveMQ Artemis, the plan is to get the SSPS added as a feature to the existing set of features of Apache ActiveMQ Artemis. 

SSPS on another distributed broker like Apache Kafka could also be seen as a potential future work. Since Apache Kafka is popularly used for streaming applications, it would help demonstrate the potential of SSPS.

Another task could be to improve the Adaptive sampling algorithm that the sampling broker uses. The current algorithm uses a pessimistic assumption regarding the amortization time of the dictionary. Ideally, the algorithm should be aware of the resource usage and also have input from bandwidth infrastructure.
